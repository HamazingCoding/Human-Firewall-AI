# Real-Time AI Voice Detection Mobile App

## Overview
This mobile application listens to incoming phone calls in real-time and alerts users when AI-generated voices are detected, providing protection against sophisticated social engineering attacks.

## Key Features
- Real-time monitoring of incoming call audio
- On-device AI detection of synthetic voices
- Immediate audio alerts when AI voices are detected
- Minimal battery and performance impact
- Privacy-focused design with limited data collection

## Technical Architecture

### App Components
1. **Call Monitor Service** - Intercepts and monitors incoming call audio
2. **Audio Processor** - Analyzes audio streams in real-time
3. **AI Detection Engine** - Local ML model to identify synthetic voices
4. **Alert System** - Provides audio and visual warnings to users
5. **Settings Manager** - Controls user preferences and sensitivity options

## Testing the Feature

### Development Testing
1. **Simulated Call Environment**
   - Create a test harness that simulates phone calls with pre-recorded audio
   - Include samples of both real and AI-generated voice recordings
   - Measure detection accuracy and false positive rates

2. **Manual Testing Process**
   ```
   1. Install test build on development device
   2. Use a second phone to call the test device
   3. Play AI-generated audio through the second device
   4. Verify alert triggers on the test device
   5. Repeat with human voice to verify no false positive
   ```

3. **Automated Testing**
   - Batch testing with hundreds of audio samples
   - Continuous integration to verify each build maintains accuracy

### Production Testing
For end users to test the app's functionality:

1. **Demo Mode**
   - Include a built-in demo feature that simulates an incoming call with AI voice
   - Users can experience how the detection and alerts work without waiting for a real call

2. **Test Number**
   - Provide a dedicated test phone number that plays AI-generated content
   - Users can call this number to verify the app is working correctly

3. **Manual Testing by Users**
   - Users can have a friend use an AI voice generator during a call
   - Popular voice changing apps can be used for this purpose

### Performance Metrics
- Detection accuracy: >95% for known AI voice models
- Response time: <2 seconds from AI voice detection to alert
- False positive rate: <1%
- Battery impact: <5% additional battery usage per day

## Deployment Considerations
- App store review process may require justification for call audio access
- Enterprise distribution options for organizations
- Regional variations to comply with local privacy laws
